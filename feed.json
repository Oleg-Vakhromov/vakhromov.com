By themselves, they are nothing more than two images, indistinguishable from trillions of others. But together, they unlock the sound of a beating heart hidden within.</p>\n<p>In my recent project, I explored the fascinating intersection of sound and image by creating a unique puzzle—a visual and auditory artifact that could only be unlocked through the pairing of a matching image. To add a layer of digital innovation, I realized this concept as a pair of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are NFTs?</h4>\n<p>NFTs are unique digital assets stored on a blockchain, representing ownership of a specific item, such as art, music, or collectibles. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are non-fungible, meaning each token is distinct and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis. Their uniqueness and traceable ownership make NFTs a revolutionary medium for creators and collectors.</p>",
